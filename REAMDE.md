1. We authenticate using the personal access token of GitHub to get users from Dublin with followers more than 50 then fetch them using the GET request, extract their details, then query their repositories and save the data into users.csv and repositories.csv.
2. The most captivating result was that a significant proportion of users with lengthy bios had a comparatively higher average count of followers which indicates that detailed personal descriptions tend to increase the chances of getting more followers on GitHub.
3. Our recommendation is that developers should pay more attention towards composing long and intriguing bios to their GitHub profiles since our analysis shows that the length of the bio is directly proportional to the number of followers, which expands oneâ€™s sphere of interaction on GitHub.
